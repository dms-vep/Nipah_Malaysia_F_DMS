## Supplemental Data

This directory contains supplemental files for the Nipah F DMS manuscript. 

The files are organized as follows:
- `designed_oPools/`: Contains the DNA sequences of the designed oligonucleotide pools ordered from Twist Biosciences.
- `destination_vectors/`: Contains plasmid maps of the six destination vectors used for cloning mutagenized tiles into the Nipah F gene.
- `genbank/`: Contains GenBank accession numbers for sequences used in the manuscript.
- `plasmids/`: Contains maps of plasmids used in the study.
- `primers/`: Contains sequences of primers used in the study
- `unmutated_reference/`: Contains the DNA sequence of the codon-optimized, CT-truncated Nipah F gene used as the parental sequence for mutagenesis.
